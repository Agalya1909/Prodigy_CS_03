# Password Complexity Checker

## Introduction

The Password Complexity Checker is a Python script designed to assess the strength of passwords based on various criteria. It analyzes passwords to determine their complexity level and provides feedback on areas for improvement. This tool helps users create stronger passwords that are more resistant to attacks.

## Description

The script utilizes the zxcvbn library, which is a password strength estimator. It evaluates passwords against a set of criteria, such as length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, special characters, and non-continuous sequences. Additionally, it provides feedback on the strength of the password and suggests improvements for enhancing security.

## Libraries or Language Used

Python: The script is written in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language.
zxcvbn: The zxcvbn library is used for analyzing password strength and providing feedback on password complexity.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter a password to check when prompted.
3. The script will analyze the password and provide feedback on its complexity.
4. Optionally, follow the suggestions provided to improve the password's strength.
5. Enter 'exit' to terminate the program.

## Example

### Code

```python
Password Complexity Checker
A strong password should include:
- At least 8 characters
- Both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
- No continuous sequences of letters or numbers

Enter a password to check (or 'exit' to quit): myStrongPassword123!
Password meets all requirements.

Password complexity status: Very Strong
```

## How it Works

1. The script prompts the user to enter a password.
2. It evaluates the password against predefined criteria, such as length, character types, and sequences.
3. The zxcvbn library assesses the password's strength and provides a score ranging from 0 (very weak) to 4 (very strong).
4. The script displays the password complexity status and any warnings or suggestions for improvement.
5. Users can follow the suggestions provided to create stronger passwords.
